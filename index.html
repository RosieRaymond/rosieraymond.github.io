              <p class="mb-4 text-white">
                The most common childhood disabilities are autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome,ADHD, genetic disorders, intellectual disabilities, and spina bifida (CDC, 2021).

              <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-white">Reactions of parents</h3>
              <p class="mb-4 text-white">
               There are a range of reactions that a parent may have after recieving a diagnosis. Some parents experience many negative emotions such as, guilt, denial, and anger (Heiman, 2002). Parents who recieve a diagnosis before their child is born can nearly completly avoid some of these negative emotions when their child is born. There are other factors that can increase the impact on the parent or decrease it. One of these factors is optimism (Peer, 2012). If a parent is an optimistic person they are less likely to experience the negative emotions or lessen the extent to which they feel them. One factor that can increase the effect of the negtaive emotions is perceived or actual severity of the disability. If the disability is severe or is percieved to be severe, parents will experience the negative emotions and higher levels of stress. Additionally, parents might question their ability to care for their child.

              <p class="text-white">
                It is currently estimated that about 17% of children will be diagnosed with a developmental disability (CDC, 2021). The CDC also says that some groups are more likely to be diagnosed with a developmental disability than others. These groups include boys, non-hispanic individuals, and those who have health insurance. This is not to say that these individuals are more at risk for having a developmental disability, they are simply more likely to gain a diagnosis. Additionally, the rates of diagnosis have gone up in recent years. While the exact cause of this is increase is unknown, it is believed to be a result of more children having access to testing.

              <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4">Social Support</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                Seeking social support from those experiencing the same or similar 
				things to you can be especially benefitial for parents (Kerr, 2000).
				This can be especially helpful those who are first getting their 
				child's diagnosis. As a parent, receiving a diagnosis can elicit 
				a multitude of emotions such as anger, guilt, denial, or happiness 
				in some cases (Heiman, 2002). These negative emotions are more present
				in parents who did not know that their child would have a disability 
				before the child was born while those who knew their child would have
				a disability may not experience these emotions as they have had more 
				time to cope. Strong social support before a diagnosis can also help
				mediate some of the negative emotions that occur once a diagnosis is
				given (Peer, 2012). Social support has also been found to lower levels
				of depression among mothers (Carlson, 2017). Overall, a strong support 
				system is very important in the coping process for parents and is the 
				most effetive coping mechanism.

              <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4">Spiritual Support</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                Spiritual support and religion can also be effective in helping parents
				cope with their child having disability. This can be especially helpful
				for immigrant parents. Immigrant parents face more obstacles than those
				who are not immigrants, for example there are possible financial and 
				language barriers that they encounter (Alsharaydeh, 2019).
				Alsharaydeh (2019) as found that strong spiritual connections made 
				parents more resilient. There is a clear connection between spirituality 
				and coping that is most prominent in those who already have strong 
				spiritual beliefs.

              <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4">Seeking Information</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                Information is important in coping with disability, it's hard to cope with
				something that you don't understand. The best place to get this kind of 
				support is doctors however, Kerr (2000) found that often times parents
				felt as if they were not given enough information from their doctors.
				This leaves a lot of the research up to parents. The more a parent knows
				about their child the better they will feel about their ability to properly
				care for their child.

              <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4">Escape Avoidance</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                While this is not the best coping mechanism there is, some parents opt to 
				avoid the problem completly, this is called the escape avoidance method 
				(Paster, 2009). While this is not the healthiest way to cope with the
				problem, it is a way that allows parents to avoid the negative feelings 
				that can come with being told that "your child has a disability". In 
				general, everyone copes differently with some parents opting for social 
				support and others opt to avoid the problem altogether. In a study of 6
				women, less than half the women used the escape avoidance method opting 
				for other methods of coping (Bingham, 2012).

            <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4">Finding all my data</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                I started this process by doing some preliminary research to see what type of information was already out there on parental coping mechanisms. To my surprise there was not a lot out there and what I did find was research that many people would not be able to understand. I next completed a Google search using key terms like "parents, coping, disability" and found more information in layterms. However, I did notice that these websites did not include all the information that I would look for if I were a parent trying to cope with having a child with a disability. That's when I decided to create this website with all the information I could find. Next it was time to gather my data and research. I first turned to Google Scholar which is where I found all my scholarly sources. I used terms similar to the preliminary search. Each article I found gave me a new piece of information such as a new coping mechanism or how having a child with a disability can mentally impact the parent. I then limited the research I would include to peer reviewed sources from the year 2000 or earlier so I could have the most up to date data. After finding a ton of research there were still some missing pieces that I needed to fill in such as general data about what disabilities are most common and how many people are impacted by disability. For this information I used the CDC webiste which gave me the rest of my data.
